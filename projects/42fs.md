I just implemented it. The ultimate filesystem which can answer the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.

[ [GitHub](https://github.com/agrrh-/42fs) ]

### How it works:

    $ ./42fs /tmp/src /tmp/dst

    $ ls -1 /tmp/dst
    file

    $ cat /tmp/src/file
    Hello, world!

    $ cat /tmp/dst/file
    42

Great day.

See [wiki 42 article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) if didn't catch a joke. :)
