You gonna need Love2d to launch the game: [download LOVE](https://love2d.org/)

The big feature is that Love works on three most popular desktop systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Write here, play anywhere!

I'm sure that code is *very* far from ideal, please forgive me about that, I never saw LUA before yesterday. :)
