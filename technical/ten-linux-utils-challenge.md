I was asked to name 10 linux console commands/utils consist of 3 symbols. To be honest, I ended up about 7-8 of those.

After couple of minutes at home I managed to beat this challenge, here's my list:

```
cat/tac
top
tar/dar/zip
git
vim
ldd
sed/awk
apt
cut
cpp/c++
dig
who
```

And yes, not sure about `vim` and `git` cause you probably miss them in default Debian installation, which I referred to.
