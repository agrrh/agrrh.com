Title: Snake in LOVE
Tags: lua, love2d, games

One more simple game reimplementation, now it's the Snake implementation (called Python in "Learning C for beginners" book, where I saw it for the first time at age ~7). Again LUA and Love2d.

You gonna need Love2d to launch the game: [download LOVE](https://love2d.org/)

Same warning, as before - code looks ugly cause of using dumb if-then approach, zero optimizations or code prettifying attempts was made.
